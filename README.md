## The reason I tried to change this website.

### üìçhttp://www.tgif.co.kr/main.asp 
### üìçhttps://www.tgifridays.com 
> This is original tgif websites (korea/State) 

When I open **korean website** I felt that website doesn't use layout for **full-screen mode** So It's a bit hard to see the content.<br>
So I tried to change whole layour for **full-screen mode**<br>
Plus, All pages looks like normal restaurant menu, not a proper website. So I tried to make whole new layout for menu.<br>
Otherwise **State website** doesn't have a content even though they made webstie, also main page only has **Big slides** <br>
So, I tried to combined two websites and make new one :) 



 ## I tried to change like this. 

1. Changing whole layout to give a professional vibe on the website. 

2. Trying to highlight their food & beverage by making the section wider 

3. Even though they're doing events those things, but they do not post on their website. So customer hard to know it is exist or not, So I made banner on the bottom of the main page to highlight 


4. For making it user-friendly, I made 'TOP' button for users that they do not have to scroll all the way back to the top 



## What I change in code

As you can see, Even though they made their own website, doesn't put contents in there. 
So users can be confused about it. That's why I combined Those two website's **strength**. 
I changed this website into resposive webpage. 
Because They do not have application so They really need a responsive webpage for mobile users. 
I made breakpoints : 

(min-width:1024px) and (max-width:1365px)  /* Tablets in landscape mode, older desktop monitors */ <br>
(min-width:768px) and (max-width:1023px)  /* Tablets in portrait mode, large display smartphones landscape mode*/<br>
(max-width:420px) /* Smartphones in portrait mode */




#### Changed css code 

I didn't know using **':root'** element before so wrote every element values by myself, even though I kept writing same values. 
So After studying **':root'** element so I changed it like this

Plus, I went to academy and took classes but didn't learn about **Responsive layout grid** So had to search about by myself. 
This is the first time I really tried to use it. 
Here is the websites that I learned by myself

This is css with **flex-box**

## What I like the most on my website 

1. I really like that I tried to make responsive website with the materials that I found out. <br>
   I could have the result that I wanted to get

2. I tried to make the landing page much more remarkable when users open the website. 
   So I designed top of the landing page with circle shape and also use their representative color!

3. When you see the **original website** They do not have detailed page about the menu. 
So I made detailed page and also add **Other options for Appetizers** to give more options to users.

4. In Brand Story, Font-size, layout are densed so users hard to read. 
So I changed the layout,font and image size for users can read it much more comfortable.
